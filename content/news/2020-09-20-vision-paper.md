## Sharing our vision

Following months of intense discussion and preparation the EuSSI consortium has put together a white paper: [A vision for supporting research software sustainability across Europe and beyond](https://zenodo.org/record/4015123#.X1s99mgzYdU). In this paper we summarise our the main ideas and provide a basis to establish the requirements across the European software sustainability landscape for best practices in developing research software.

We invite you to give us your opinion and join us in building a sustainable sofware infrastructure across Europe and beyond!
