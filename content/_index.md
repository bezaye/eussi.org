## About EUSSI

Research software is an essential  output in different research domains and needs to be reproducible and extendable throughout future research. Achieving this requires shared principles and know-how among researchers and research institutes. The European Software Sustainability Infrastructure (EuSSI) consortium aims towards identifying  key elements and providing common grounds to achieve such a goal in European level. Partners in the EuSSI consortium are all involved - in one way or another - in research software and share a common interest in improving the general quality of research software. This includes various aspects such as the availability of software in the future and the ability to reuse software beyond the project for which it was created. We generally refer to this as *Software Sustainability*.

Although consortium members already collaborate with each other, we still approach software sustainability in different ways. Coordination at a European level will help to align our approaches and provide a unified set of best practices of research software (in alignment with the emerging FAIR principles for research software).

Sharing best practices in research software development across Europe will promote reuse of research software across European organisations. This will help to accelerate scientific discoveries across Europe and help reduce intrinsic costs incurred when research software is created from each project, without building on previously existing software.
